# Edible-Mushrooms
The main pet project for Sep - Dec 2021.
--
The idea is to detect whether the mushroom is edible or not using Deep Learning. Some of the (al)-most modern approaches are used here. 

The main goal is to achieve good Edible Precision due to the fact that it is better not to eat the suspicious mushroom than vice versa.

In the nearest future this project will probably evolve into mushroom classification (#TODO: Parse more mushroom species)

All project is done in Google Colab. The keras framework is used to implement deep learning here. More details in the code.
